# map-guessing-game-frontend (LDN Knowledge)


## test your knowledge of London... improve it... or just guess wildly for fun!

Game live at http://ldn-knowledge.herokuapp.com/ - the backend will take a few seconds to wake up on first play. It is playable once the high scores are displayed.

Javascript frontend, with a Ruby on Rails backend here: https://github.com/braj011/map-guessing-game-backend

## How the game works

- A game starts once a player has entered a name and either selects a difficulty, or hits enter (which begins an easy game)
- A static map centered around a random London postcode is displayed to the user, initially obscured by 9 squares
- As soon as the game begins, one square is removed, with the remainder gradually fading over the course of the game
